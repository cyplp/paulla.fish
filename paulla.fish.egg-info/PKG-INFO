        ===========
        
        File sharing
        
        Aim :
        Simple sharing file with preview for most.
        
        
        roadmap :
        
        use couchdb and remove sqlite
         serve file with random uuid and not with id from db
        
        one shot add multiple file
        
        automatic garbage (1 week => expire => 2 week => delete : if downloaded : add 1 week)
        
        admin section for remove file if somebody ask to delete
        
        add preview for most common files (player for open video/music file, reader for documents etc...)
        
        login or not
         
        Private & public sharing (with a key or password : to determine)
        
        and what we need...
